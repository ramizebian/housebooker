# Facebook F8 Hackathon


###### Inspiration
> Facebook has the abiity to gather data about people (via Facebook Profile), work environment (via Facebook Workplace). Why not granting Facebook the potential of gathering data about your house and iOT devices used and use this kind of data for a better Ad targeting based on behaviour and for controlling your ioT devices in a better way with access control and privacy?
###### What it does
> Housebooker is a platform that allows Facebook users to Login and manage their iOT devices at home and work.
###### Effect on the community
> Grant Facebook access to home and work devices (Example open door lock, manage the AC/Heater at work, etc..)
> Facebook can target Ads based on the behaviour of each user. Example:
> <ol>
> <li>Light behaviours (Hours of sleep, number of hours a person spends in the house, etc..)</li>
> <li>Door Lock behvoiur (How many hours does this person spend outside the house)</li>
> <li>Microwave (Possible information gathering about the preferred type of food)</li>
> <li>AC/Heater (Information gathering related to temperature)</li>
> </ol>
> 
> Share access on ioT device with Facebook user's (Example grant your Mom access to your car lock, Grant your friend access to your house lock, etc...)
> Ability to remove your access from devices you were invited to control
> Ability to request access to devices you might be intersted in. Implementation of AI might be required here. Example:
> <ol>
> <li>Prompt the user to request access to a house door lock incase the user checked in (on Facebook) next to a friend's house</li>
> <li>Prompt the user to request access to the work door lock or AC/Heater based on the workplace set up on his Facebook profile</li>
> <li>Suggest installing an ioT device at home based on the behaviour on his Facebook profile (For example, if this person is intersted in food suggest installing a microwave. If this person is intersted in pets, suggest installing a pet food autofill can. If this person is intersted in romance, suggest installing a lightning system. If this person is highly energetic and loves music, suggest installing a sound system.</li>
> </ol>

###### What's next
> Access all those ioT devices via Facebook and via an external application. In other words, include a new platfrom on Facebook called "My house". When the user visits his "house" via Facebook. He will be able to manage all his devices and share permissions with his Facebook friends based on his needs. This can help better organize our lives, secure our ioT devices under Facebook's security policies and privacy rules, target Ads based on users' behaviours inside their houses.
