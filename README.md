### Housebooker 
###### What it does
>A platform to manage all your ioT devices at home, workplace, studio, etc.. with the ability to invite and grant access to other users from your Facebook's friend list. Access invitations can be either scheduled (effective within a timespan) or manually performed. "Request to Access" other devices prompts depending on the location & activity of the logged in user (For example, if the logged in user is in San Jose, the system will show him devices for friends/relatives in the area he might be interested in requesting access to them).
